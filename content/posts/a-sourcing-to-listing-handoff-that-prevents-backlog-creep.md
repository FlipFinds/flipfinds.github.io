Backlog usually starts before the item reaches your shelf.
It starts when sourcing and listing are treated as separate jobs with no handoff standard between them.

## The handoff rule

Every item you source should leave sourcing with enough information for the listing step to start immediately.

If the item enters your inventory pile without a title draft, cost, and condition note, it becomes delayed work.

## A practical sourcing-to-listing handoff (12 minutes per batch)

Use this after each sourcing trip or buy session.

1. **Sort the batch by priority**
   Group items into quick-list, medium effort, and research-needed.

2. **Record cost and quantity immediately**
   Do not wait until listing day to reconstruct receipts or memory.

3. **Write a short title draft or keyword notes**
   You are not writing the final listing. You are removing the blank-page problem.

4. **Add one condition note**
   Example: "light wear on left edge" or "tested, powers on."

5. **Assign a listing destination**
   Put each item into a bin or queue that maps to your next listing session.

## Example batch

A reseller sources 14 items on Saturday.
Instead of stacking them for "later," they record cost, condition, and listing notes for all 14 in one session.

On Monday, listing starts faster because:

- item cost is already recorded
- keywords are already drafted
- condition notes are already captured

The result is less backlog and fewer skipped listings.

## Common backlog mistakes

1. Cleaning and testing first, but recording nothing
2. Waiting to enter costs until end of week
3. Mixing quick-list items with research-heavy items
4. Leaving sourced inventory without a next listing queue

## What to do this week

Run one handoff session after your next sourcing trip.
Your goal is not perfect listings. Your goal is to remove friction before listing starts.
