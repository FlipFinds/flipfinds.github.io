When inventory gets messy, profit usually leaks in small ways you do not notice until the month ends.
Listings stay stale, buy costs are not compared against sell-through, and tracking becomes inconsistent week to week.
A short weekly reset keeps your numbers clean and your sourcing decisions sharper.

## A 15-minute weekly inventory routine

1. **Open sold and active items (3 minutes).**
Check what sold this week and what has been sitting too long.

2. **Flag stale listings (3 minutes).**
Mark items older than 45 days that need a reprice, better photos, or a relist plan.

3. **Review margin leakage (4 minutes).**
Pick 10 recent sales and confirm your net after fees, shipping, and supplies.
If margins are slipping, note the likely cause.

4. **Set next-week inventory actions (3 minutes).**
Choose your top 3 actions: reprice, relist, bundle, or clear dead stock.
Keep it specific so execution is easy.

5. **Log one number to track consistency (2 minutes).**
Record active items, sold items, and stale-item count so you can compare week over week.

## Why this works

You do not need a complicated dashboard to stay in control.
A repeatable weekly routine improves inventory quality, protects margin, and reduces reactive decisions.
