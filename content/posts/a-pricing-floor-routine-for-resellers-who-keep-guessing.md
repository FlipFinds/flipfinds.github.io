When pricing happens in a rush, margin leaks out in small ways: shipping gets underestimated, fees get ignored, and discounts start from a weak number.
The fix is not a complicated spreadsheet. It is a short pricing floor routine you can run before you list.

## Use a floor before you pick a list price

Start by separating two decisions:

1. Your minimum acceptable net profit
2. Your public list price

Most resellers reverse these. They pick a list price first, then hope the margin works.

## A 10-minute pricing floor routine

1. **Set your minimum net profit target**
   Choose one target for the item type (for example: "$12 net minimum" for small electronics).

2. **Estimate total cost to sell**
   Include purchase cost, shipping materials, platform fees, and expected shipping cost.

3. **Calculate the lowest acceptable sale price**
   Work backward from your net target. This is your floor, not your public price.

4. **Check recent sold comps**
   Compare your floor to recent sold prices. If your floor is above the market, change the buy decision next time instead of forcing a bad listing.

5. **Set list price with room to negotiate**
   List above the floor so you can accept offers without falling below target.

## Example

You buy an item for $18.
You estimate $2 in packing supplies, $7 shipping, and $8 in marketplace fees.
You want at least $12 net profit.

Your floor is not "$30 because it feels right."
Your floor must cover:

- $18 cost
- $2 supplies
- $7 shipping
- $8 fees
- $12 target net

That means selling below $47 is already below your target.

## Mistakes that cause pricing leakage

1. Using listed comps instead of sold comps
2. Ignoring shipping on heavier or larger items
3. Accepting offers without checking floor price first
4. Repricing downward without updating the margin target

## What to do this week

Pick one category you list often and create a repeatable net-profit floor target for it.
Run this routine on your next five listings and compare outcomes.
