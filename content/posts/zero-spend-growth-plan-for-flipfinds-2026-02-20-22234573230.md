Most reseller stalls are not sourcing problems.  
They are listing execution problems.

If inventory is sitting too long, try these three changes before buying more stock.

## Hypothesis
Tightening listing clarity, pricing cadence, and photo quality will increase weekly sell-through without ad spend.

## Action Plan
1. Update titles on 20 stale listings with buyer-search language first (brand, model, size, condition).
2. Reprice those same listings using a weekly rule instead of one-time pricing.
3. Replace the first image on low-performing listings with a cleaner, brighter hero shot.

## Success Metric
Primary metric: sell-through rate increase of at least 10% on the updated listing group in 7 days.

## 1) Fix titles for search intent

Weak title: `Nike shirt mens`  
Better title: `Nike Dri-FIT Men's Large Black Running Shirt`

Buyers search for specifics. Your title should answer:

1. What is it?
2. Who is it for?
3. What condition is it in?

If these are missing, your listing loses qualified traffic.

## 2) Use a weekly repricing rule

Set a simple rule:

1. Day 0: list at target margin price.
2. Day 14: if no watchers/offers, reduce by 5%.
3. Day 30: reduce by another 5% or bundle.
4. Day 45+: relist with new title/hero photo.

This keeps inventory moving and prevents capital from getting trapped.

## 3) Upgrade the first photo only

You do not need a full photo overhaul to see improvement.

Start with one change:

1. Brighter lighting
2. Cleaner background
3. Tighter crop
4. Front-facing angle

The first image controls click-through. Better clicks usually lead to faster sales.

## Quick weekly scorecard

Track these numbers every week:

1. Sell-through rate
2. Average days-to-sale
3. Net profit per item
4. Number of stale listings over 45 days

## Call to Action
Pick 20 stale listings and apply these three tweaks today.  
Review results on 2026-02-27 and keep only the changes that improve sell-through.
