This draft was proposed by the private `flipfinds-growth-agent` workflow.

## Focus
No specific idea supplied. Use this as a weekly growth planning draft.

## Hypothesis
A practical weekly operations checklist will improve reseller decision quality and increase organic discovery for FlipFinds content.

## Action Plan
1. Publish this post and link it from related reseller articles.
2. Create 2-3 short repurposed snippets for social/community posts.
3. Update dashboard KPI values once first-week traffic data arrives.

## Success Metric
Primary metric: weekly organic clicks (target +25 over current baseline).

## Review Date
2026-02-27

## Zero-Spend Actions
1. Publish one high-intent educational post in the reseller niche.
2. Repurpose that post into short-form social snippets.
3. Add one measurable KPI update to the dashboard data.

## Call to Action
Run this process once this week, then compare your weekly KPI change in 7 days.

## Approval Notes
- Approval requirement: none
- If account creation or paid action is requested, PR must include `needs-approval` and `approved-to-execute` before any risky execution.
