A good reseller week is not about doing everything. It is about running one repeatable workflow from sourcing to listing.
When you keep this routine tight, you spend less time on low-value tasks and more time on inventory that can actually move.

## Weekly sourcing-to-listing routine

1. Source with a target category list and clear buy limits.
2. Process new items the same day with consistent titles, photos, and condition notes.
3. Publish listings in one focused batch.
4. Review stale items and make repricing decisions before the week ends.

## Weekly check-in

Track how many items were sourced, listed, and sold.
If listed count is falling behind sourced count, reduce buying volume next week until the pipeline catches up.
