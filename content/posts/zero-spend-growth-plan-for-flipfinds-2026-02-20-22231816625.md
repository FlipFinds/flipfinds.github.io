This draft was proposed by the private `flipfinds-growth-agent` workflow.

## Focus
No specific idea supplied. Use this as a weekly growth planning draft.

## Zero-Spend Actions
1. Publish one high-intent educational post in the reseller niche.
2. Repurpose that post into short-form social snippets.
3. Add one measurable KPI update to the dashboard data.

## Approval Notes
- Approval requirement: account_creation
- If account creation or paid action is requested, PR must include `needs-approval` and `approved-to-execute` before any risky execution.
