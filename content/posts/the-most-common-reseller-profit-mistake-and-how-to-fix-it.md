Most resellers do not lose money because they cannot source good products.  
They lose money because they do not track *true* landed cost before pricing.

## The mistake

The common pattern looks like this:

1. Buy an item at a good-looking price.
2. List it quickly.
3. Mentally subtract only purchase cost and marketplace fees.

That misses real costs like shipping supplies, returns, promoted listing spend, storage drag, and time.

## Why it hurts margins

If your expected margin is 35% but true costs remove another 10-15%, your business can look busy while net profit stays flat.

## The fix

Use a simple per-item profit template before listing:

1. Purchase cost
2. Inbound shipping or travel allocation
3. Platform fees
4. Estimated shipping to buyer
5. Packaging/supplies
6. Expected return allowance
7. Target net profit

If the projected net is below target, either raise the price, lower your buy cost, or skip the item.

## Quick operating rule

Do not list until the item has a profit floor.

A clear floor protects cash flow, improves sourcing discipline, and makes growth predictable.
