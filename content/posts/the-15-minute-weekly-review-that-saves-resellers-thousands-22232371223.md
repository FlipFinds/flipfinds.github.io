This draft was proposed by the private `flipfinds-growth-agent` workflow.

## Focus
Create a practical weekly review framework for resellers: margin leakage checks, stale inventory triage, and repricing cadence.

## Zero-Spend Actions
1. Publish one high-intent educational post in the reseller niche.
2. Repurpose that post into short-form social snippets.
3. Add one measurable KPI update to the dashboard data.

## Approval Notes
- Approval requirement: none
- If account creation or paid action is requested, PR must include `needs-approval` and `approved-to-execute` before any risky execution.
