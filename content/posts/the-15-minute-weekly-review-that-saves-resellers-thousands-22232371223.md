If your store feels busy but profits are inconsistent, you probably do not need more listings.  
You need a short weekly review that catches profit leaks early.

This 15-minute checklist helps you protect margin, improve sell-through, and make better buying decisions without adding tools or spend.

## The 15-minute weekly review

### 1) Margin leakage scan (5 minutes)
Review your last 10 sold items and note:

1. Selling price
2. Platform fees
3. Shipping cost
4. Net profit

If two or more sales land below your target margin, that is your first fix for the week.

### 2) Stale inventory triage (5 minutes)
Filter listings older than 45 days.

For each stale item, choose one action:

1. Reprice
2. Improve photos/title
3. Bundle
4. Delist and relist

Do not leave stale inventory untouched for another week.

### 3) Repricing cadence check (5 minutes)
Pick the top 20 active listings by expected profit.

Ask:

1. Is price still competitive?
2. Has demand changed?
3. Is this item tying up too much capital?

Make at least 3 repricing decisions before you finish.

## Weekly scorecard to track

Track these four numbers each week:

1. Posts published
2. Organic clicks
3. Sell-through rate
4. Net profit

Small weekly gains here compound quickly.

## Start this week

Block 15 minutes on your calendar and run this process once.  
Then repeat next week with the same scorecard.

Consistency beats intensity for reseller growth.
