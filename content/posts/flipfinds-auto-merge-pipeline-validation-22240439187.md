Reseller growth usually breaks when your weekly habits break.
A short validation pass each week helps you keep sourcing, listing, and inventory tracking aligned.

## Weekly validation checklist

1. Confirm your sourced-item count and listed-item count are moving together.
2. Spot-check recent sales for margin leaks from fees, shipping, or underpricing.
3. Reprice or relist stale inventory so old stock does not stall your cash flow.
4. Set one clear process fix for next week.

## Keep it practical

You do not need a big overhaul every week.
Small, consistent process fixes usually beat one-off deep cleanup sessions.
