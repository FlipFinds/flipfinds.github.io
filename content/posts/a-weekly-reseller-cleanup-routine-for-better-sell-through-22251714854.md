Inventory chaos usually shows up as tiny losses: stale listings, missed repricing, and thin margins.
A short weekly operating routine fixes this without adding tools or spend.

This post gives you a simple operating routine you can run once a week to reduce stale inventory and protect margin.
Use it as a checklist, not a theory document.

## The 15-minute weekly routine

1. **Scan active inventory (3 minutes).**
Filter items older than 45 days and mark which need repricing, retitle, or relist.

2. **Check recent sold items (3 minutes).**
Review the last 10 sales and verify net after fees, shipping, and supplies.
If two or more items miss target margin, flag the category for correction.

3. **Fix stale-item actions (4 minutes).**
Choose one action per stale item: reprice, improve listing quality, bundle, or clear.
Do not defer all stale items to "later."

4. **Set next sourcing guardrails (3 minutes).**
Use what sold this week to choose what to buy next week.
Reduce buys in categories where stale count is climbing.

5. **Log one weekly snapshot (2 minutes).**
Record active items, sold items, stale items, and average net margin for the week.
Consistency matters more than perfect reporting.

## Example from a reseller week

Example: a reseller with 220 active items finds 34 stale listings, reprices 12, and clears 5 in the next 7 days.
That is the goal of this routine: fewer random decisions, faster cleanup, and more predictable weekly output.

## Common mistakes to avoid

1. Running the review without taking action on stale listings.
2. Tracking only revenue and ignoring net margin.
3. Buying new inventory while old stock remains unaddressed.
4. Changing too many variables in one week and losing signal.

## Weekly scorecard

Track these every week:

1. Active item count
2. Stale item count (45+ days)
3. Units sold
4. Net margin trend

Small improvements each week compound over a month.

## Next step

Run this routine once this week and compare your stale count and margin next week.
