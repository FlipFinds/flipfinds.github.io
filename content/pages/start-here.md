If you are new to FlipFinds, use this page as your 10-minute setup + first workflow path.

{{< author_box >}}

## 1) Install the app

{{< app_cta source="start_here" campaign="install_cta" >}}

## 2) Read one workflow post each week

Start with the practical posts:

- [A Weekly Reseller Cleanup Routine for Better Sell-Through](/posts/a-weekly-reseller-cleanup-routine-for-better-sell-through-22251714854/)
- [Browse all posts](/posts/)
- [Guides hub](/guides/)

## 3) Apply one change immediately

Use each article as an operating routine, not just reading material.  
Pick one action, run it this week, and keep the habit consistent.

## 4) Keep going with the next step

- Review the [Guides hub](/guides/) by topic
- Install FlipFinds and run the same workflow in the app
