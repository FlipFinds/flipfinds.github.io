If you are new to FlipFinds, use this page as your weekly operating guide.

## 1) Install the app

{{< app_cta source="start_here" campaign="install_cta" >}}

## 2) Read one workflow post each week

Start with the practical posts:

- [The Most Common Reseller Profit Mistake (And How to Fix It)](/posts/the-most-common-reseller-profit-mistake-and-how-to-fix-it/)
- [A 15-Minute Weekly Reseller Review to Protect Your Margin](/posts/the-15-minute-weekly-review-that-saves-resellers-thousands-22232371223/)

## 3) Apply one change immediately

Use each article as an operating checklist, not just reading material.  
Pick one action, run it this week, and keep the habit consistent.
