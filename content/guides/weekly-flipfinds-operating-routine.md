This routine is designed for busy resellers who need consistency more than complexity.

## 1) Monday: Sourcing pass (10 min)

Capture likely buys first. Prioritize clean margin opportunities over volume.

## 2) Wednesday: Listing quality pass (10 min)

Improve titles, photos, and pricing on your highest-value active items.

## 3) Friday: Profit protection pass (10 min)

Review low-margin sales and stale inventory. Reprice, bundle, or relist quickly.

## Weekly scorecard

Track these four numbers:

1. New listings published
2. Sell-through rate
3. Net profit per sold item
4. Stale listings resolved

Run this every week. Operational consistency compounds.
